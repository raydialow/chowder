# Chowder Game Engine

Engine and very eventually SDK built on SDL with Chicken Scheme. 

## Building

Build requires SDL2 and SDL2-Image packages. Install sdl2 and coops eggs first: `chicken-install sdl2 sdl2-image coops`. Then do `make` from the repository root. Should build whatever is here. It's not much yet.
